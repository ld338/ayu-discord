# Ayu Mirage Discord

A Discord theme using the beautiful [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-colors) color palettes.

# Usage

By default, this theme modifies Discord's colors and rearranges its layout some. It also includes some additional optional modifications, which are not enabled by default. These options can be enabled by un-commenting the respective lines in the import file. (You may need to reload the theme/reload your client to apply the changes)

# Installation

For the sake of being concise, `import file` will refer to any of `mirage.css`, `dark.css`, and `light.css`.
