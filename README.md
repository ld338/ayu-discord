# Ayu Discord

This is a Discord theme using the popular ayu colour palette. Right now, it only supports the mirage variant, but will be updated in the future.

**How do I use it?**

To use this theme, you'll need a CSS injector. [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) is a good injector.

Second, you'll want to download the [import.css](https://github.com/sardonicism-04/ayu-mirage-discord/blob/master/import.css) file, and then use your injector to add it to discord. This should suffice for most use cases.

However, if you're looking for everything to be in one file, you can download the `ayu-main.css` file independently and it will contain the theme with all features enabled.

That's it, you're done! When the theme is updated here on GitHub, it'll automatically be updated on your client as well.
